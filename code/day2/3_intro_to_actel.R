# Run analysis. Note: this will open an analysis report on your web browser.
exp.results <- explore(tz = 'US/Eastern', report=TRUE)


# Because this is an example dataset, this analysis will run very smoothly. 
# Real data is not always this nice to us!

# ----------
# If your analysis failed while compiling the report, you can load 
# the saved results back in using the dataToList() function:
exp.results <- dataToList("actel_explore_results.RData")


# If your analysis failed before you had a chance to save the results,
# load the pre-compiled results, so you can keep up with the workshop.
# Remember to change the path so R can find the RData file.
exp.results <- dataToList("path/to/workshop/folder/data/pre-compiled_results.RData")

# What is inside the output?
names(exp.results)

# What is inside the valid movements?
names(exp.results$valid.movements)

# let's have a look at the first one:
exp.results$valid.movements[["R64K-4451"]]

# and here are the respective valid detections:
exp.results$valid.detections[["R64K-4451"]]

# We can use these results to obtain our own plots (We will go into that later)



#-------------------------------------

# Let's load the spatial file into its own variable, so we can have a look at it.
spatial <- loadSpatial()
head(spatial)

# When doing the following steps, it is imperative that the coordinate reference 
# system (CRS) of the shapefile and of the points in the spatial file are the same.
# In this case, the values in columns "x" and "y" are already in the right CRS.

# loadShape will rasterize the input shape, using the "size" argument as a reference
# for the pixel size. Note: The units of the "size" will be the same as the units
# of the shapefile projection (i.e. metres for metric projections, and degrees for latlong systems)
#
# In this case, we are using a metric system, so we are saying that we want the pixel
# size to be 10 metres.
#
# NOTE: Change the 'path' to the folder where you have the shape file.
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
water <- loadShape(path = "path/to/workshop/folder/data",
                   shape = "stora_shape_epsg32632.shp", size = 10,
                   coord.x = "x", coord.y = "y")

# The function above can run without the coord.x and coord.y arguments. However, by including them,
# you are allowing actel to load the spatial.csv file on the fly and check if the spatial points
# (i.e. hydrophone stations and release sites) are positioned in water. This is very important,
# as any point position on land will be cut off during distance calculations.

# Now we need to create a transition layer, which R will use to estimate the distances
tl <- transitionLayer(water)

# We are ready to try it out! distancesMatrix will automatically search for a "spatial.csv"
# file in the current directory, so remember to keep that file up to date!
dist.mat <- distancesMatrix(tl, coord.x = "x", coord.y = "y")

# have a look at it:

## Migration and Residency


## Migration function:

# Let's go ahead and try running migration() on this dataset.
mig.results <- migration(tz = 'Europe/Copenhagen', report = TRUE)


## Residency function:

# Try copy-pasting the next five lines as a block and run it all at once.
res.results <- residency(tz = 'Europe/Copenhagen', report = TRUE)

This is a lovely fish

# R will know to answer each of the questions that pop up during the analysis
# with the lines you copy-pasted together with your code!

# explore the reports to see what's new!

# Note: There is a known bug in residency() as of actel 1.2.0, which for some datasets
# will cause a crash with the following error message:
#
# Error in tableInteraction(moves = secmoves, tag = tag, trigger = the.warning,  : 
#  argument "save.tables.locally" is missing, with no default
#
# This has already been corrected and a fix has been released in actel 1.2.1.
