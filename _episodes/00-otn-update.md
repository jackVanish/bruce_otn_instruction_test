The Ocean Tracking Network (OTN) supports global telemetry research by providing training, equipment, and data infrastructure to our large network of partners. The ACT Network is an important OTN partner, hosting a partner Database Node and able to cross-referencing tag detections easily between the networks. OTN supports ACT through training and support of data managers, as well as training of researchers in workshops like this one.
